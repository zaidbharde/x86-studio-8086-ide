# x86 Studio — 8086 IDE with Custom Language Layer

**x86 Studio — 8086 IDE** is an educational programming environment that combines a custom high-level language with an Intel 8086 assembly simulation engine. The system allows users to write programs in a simplified, human-friendly syntax while transparently showing how those instructions translate into real assembly code.

This dual-layer design helps learners understand the bridge between high-level logic and low-level machine behavior. As code is written in the custom language, the IDE reveals the equivalent assembly instructions and demonstrates how they execute inside a virtual 8086 CPU.

The platform is built to make system-level learning interactive and intuitive. Users can experiment with their own language constructs, observe assembly generation, and step through execution to understand registers, memory flow, and instruction behavior.

## Key Features

* Custom beginner-friendly programming language
* Automatic translation into 8086 assembly
* Virtual CPU simulation with step-by-step execution
* Real-time visibility of registers and memory behavior
* Designed for learning computer architecture and assembly

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to simplify low-level programming education by letting users code in a readable syntax while learning how assembly works behind the scenes. It bridges abstraction and hardware-level understanding in a practical way.

---

This environment is ideal for students, experimentation, and anyone curious about how high-level instructions become assembly-level operations.
